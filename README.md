## SoftwareTimeStamping

### Description

This is a PowerShell Module and DSC Resources that can Get/Enable/Disable the Software Timestamping configuration.

#### Installation

This module can be installed from the PowerShell Gallery.  To do this run the following command from an elevated PowerShell prompt:

```Install-Module SoftwareTimestamping```

Alternatively you can copy the SoftwareTimeStamping Folder into C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules
